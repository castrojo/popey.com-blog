At work people often come up to my desk and ask if they can get their password reset. I usually do this and tell them their new password. I've decided I'm missing a trick here. What I now do is this.

```
User: "Please reset my password"
Me: "Sure"
*tapety* *tap* *tap*
Me: "Right, your password is 'ubuntu'"
User: "Huh?"
Me: "Here, take this, it will help you"
```

I hand them an Ubuntu CD pack. They get to read the cover of the CD pack on the way back to their desk. Perfect.

For the security paranoid amongst you I guess I should change it to "ubuntu" followed by a couple of letters or symbols and vary this each time. Oh and these are LAN based passwords that they have to change on first logon.
