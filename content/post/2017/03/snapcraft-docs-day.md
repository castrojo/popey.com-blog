## Announcing Snapcraft Docs Day

Snap is a simple archive format for big things.

Snapcraft is a delightful tool for automatically building and publishing software for any Linux system or device. Our [documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/) and [tutorials](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/) are great for getting started with snapcraft. We can always improve these though, so this Friday, will be our first **Snapcraft Docs Day**.

 * **When**: Friday, 31st March 2017, all day
 * **Where**: #snapcraft on [Rocket Chat](https://rocket.ubuntu.com/)
 * **Who**: Developers & documentation experts of all levels

### Why we're doing this

The goal is to ensure our documentation and tutorials are useful and accurate. We’re keen to get people testing our documentation, to make sure it’s clear, understandable and comprehensive. If we’re missing anything, or there are mistakes then file those issues, or better yet, fix them yourself.

If you’ve got something you want to snap, this is also a great day to get started. We’ve personally used these tools all day every day for a couple of years now, but perhaps we’re missing something you need. Now is a great time to test the tools and let us know.

### Get involved

If you’re interested in contributing to the projects but don’t know where, here’s a great place to start. Snapcraft and Snapd are both free software, and hosted on GitHub. Snapcraft is written in Python, and Snapd is a Go-based project. The teams behind these projects are super friendly, and keen to help you contribute.

Some examples of things you might want to try:-

 * Snap your own personal projects using the [documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/) available
 * Test the [tutorials](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/) site out in different browsers / platforms
 * Confirm / triage / fix bugs in [snapd](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd), [snapcraft](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft/+bugs), [docs](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/snappy-docs/issues) and [tutorials](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/tutorials.ubuntu.com/issues)
 * Write a new Tutorial, perhaps one that has already been [requested](https://github.com/canonical-websites/tutorials.ubuntu.com/issues)

Hang out with us in #snapcraft on [Rocket Chat](https://rocket.ubuntu.com/) during the day. Many of the snapd and snapcraft developers are there to answer your questions and help you. See you there!
