One of the things I really love about working at [Influx Data](https://www.influxdata.com/careers/) is the strong social focus for employees. We're all remote workers, and the teams have strategies to enable us to connect better. One of those ways is via Chess Tournaments!

I haven't played chess for 20 years or more, and was never really any good at it. I know the basic moves, and can sustain a game, but I'm not a chess strategy guru, and don't know all the best plays. 

So I was somewhat cautious about putting my name in the hat for the (entirely optional) Influx Data chess tournament this month. However, I did, and I'm so glad I decided to. 

First of all I was invited to join a #Chess slack channel - we have channels for everything inluding pets (pictures of cats and dogs feature heavily here), pits (pictures of ribs, smokers and recipies are strong here) and #mad_props where people call out the great work of their team mates.

I then signed up to [chess.com](https://chess.com/) and played a couple of practice games. I was super rusty though, and didn't do well.

The "*Chexperts*" (sorry) in the company ran a few training sessions over Zoom where they talked us through some opening moves, strategies and pitfalls. I learned more about chess in those sessions than I expected. I'm still terrible at it though.

In the tournament, I was matched up with someone - Pat - who works in another part of the company. I used to work with Pat at Canonical, conveniently. We're apparently at a similar level - both *terribad* at Chess. We played two "10 min" games, one playing as black, and the other as white.

I joined a Zoom call at the pre-arranged time, and played my two games against Pat. The best part about this, the Chexpert, Steven - live streams it to the rest of the company on Twitch, with commentary and analysis! This I found super hilarious. While we were playing, I was seeing words of encouragement from the spectators on my team in the Slack channel. It was so much fun!

Want to see how I did? Well, the video has been kindly archived along with the other matches, along with Steven's commentary, over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodhZEzkHXqBYFuLtVR3k9A)! Check it out [here](https://youtu.be/HsDhTCNHYvM), or embedded below.

Yes, I suck at this game. But it doesn't matter, because I really enjoyed it, and found it a really great way to increase my Chess skills, while engaging with my new friends at Influx.
