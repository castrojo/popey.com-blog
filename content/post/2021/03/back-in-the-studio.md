Last month I [mentioned](/blog/2021/02/season-fourteen) that myself, [Mark](https://twitter.com/marxjohnson) and [Martin](https://twitter.com/m_wimpress) have decided to come back for Season 14 of the [Ubuntu Podcast](https://ubuntupodcast.org/). Well, we're back today with [S14E01](https://ubuntupodcast.org/2021/03/11/s14e01-navy-chefs-remit/), titled "*Navy Chefs Remit*". 

Over the thirteen years, the episode titles have had a theme in each season. We don't reveal the theme, but let our listeners figure that out, for fun. Sometimes it has a bearing on the content of the episode, but often not.

[Season One](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0QKAfxeXQMV1ep_CXLqC_RaJlyF4kAR_) used Elvis Presley singles as titles, which I think was a nod to the fact that people used to tell me I look like Elvis. In [Season Two](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0QKAfxeXQMWJgWsRsEqPkCh9vntWqGf7) we used [Tony's](https://tonywhitmore.co.uk/weddings/) love of Doctor Who to give us episode titles. 

I vaguely recall one year we used film names from the *bottom* 250 as rated on IMDB, but I don't remember the others. I'll let you figure out the [rest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCav3G8vkcXdH-sohSkTowOw/playlists) - which is a lot easier to do when you see them in a list. Some of them are pretty obscure!

This year is no different in that we have a new episode title theme! I'll be interested to see if anyone gets it after a few episodes, and pretty amazed if you do after just the [first one](https://ubuntupodcast.org/2021/03/11/s14e01-navy-chefs-remit/).

We have been very lucky to have [Bitfolk](https://bitfolk.com/) as a sponsor since the start. They've hosted the podcast on a VPS since the first episode. They've been wonderful. If you're looking for a VPS provider with excellent service, and a strong moral compass, [Bitfolk](https://bitfolk.com/) are where you should go.

We are also thankful to our [donators](https://ubuntupodcast.org/donate/) who support production of the show via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/ubuntupodcast/) and PayPal. That allows us to pay for the services of [Joe Ressington](https://joeress.com/) to produce the show. Without that money the show would almost certainly be late every week, and sound terrible. 

As always you're welcome to follow the [@ubuntupodcast](https://twitter.com/ubuntupodcast) account on Twitter and [@ubuntupodcast@octodon.social](https://octodon.social/@ubuntupodcast) on Mastodon (which is mostly just gated from Twitter, sorry).

We're also on [Telegram](https://ubuntupodcast.org/telegram) where we have a friendly bunch of people chatting about the podcast, biscuits, cats, dogs, tech, snaps, tea, coffee and whatever else is going on that day. Like the show, it's intended to be *Family Friendly* and accessible. Maybe we will see you there. 

Thanks for listening, if you do.
